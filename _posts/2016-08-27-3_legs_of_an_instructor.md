Bettering people's lives through traditional martial arts training.

The basic principles of being an instructor have not changed of the years since Soke Hirano set them for all of us to follow.  We must do three things to be an instructor; 1) Train, 2) Teach, and 3) Promote.

On the surface, the seem like very simple things to define.  Train: Show up to classes, practice at home.  Teach:  Run warm-ups, Assist in classes, and Teach classes.  Promote: Go out and bring people into the dojo.  Not everyone sees these 3 legs as an important part of being an instructor.  It is easy to make excuses, I never get to take classes, and I am nervous in front of people, so I just want to be able to take the instructor’s class.  Promoting isn’t my thing, i’ll teach, but that is just bringing money into someone else’s pockets.  I don’t have time to train, i’ll show up and teach.

If we sit back and take a look at what drives the three legs of an instructor, it takes on a different meaning.  I often wonder why we do the things we do.  Several times we have had people come in and try out our classes, maybe stay for a little while, and then you see or hear of them at a different dojo.  You begin to think that you may be doing something wrong, but the truth of the matter is you are not always the right fit. When you come to the understanding that everyone needs martial lives in their lives, it becomes much easier to swallow.  Just be happy they have it. 

I have begun to think of what is the purpose of the dojo, and Japan Karate Institute in general.  The thought that keeps coming in my mind is the following:

How does this apply to the three legs of the instructor?

To truly understand something, you must do something.  I have seen instructors who hand out punishments, or count at a ridiculous pace when teaching, but they could not or would not be able to keep up the things they do.  They are generally over the top with others.  By getting on the floor you understand what others are going through.  You also build a bond with those around going through a shared experience.  This shared experience is fundamental for being an instructor, you can assist someone during or after class with the things you had problems with in class.  Sharing with others is what creates a bond between you and that person that can make both of you grow.

Teaching means much more standing up and counting.  It can be individual or to the group.  It can be you setting the example in class for training hard and having good spirit.  It can be you helping your partner figure out how to work on a round house kick.  I see it over and over where people believe that an instructor is someone who runs a class.  Just as you are setting the example in class, and people are striving to be you, you may be striving to be the one at the front of the class.  This may be your only goal for being an instructor.  The biggest mistake made is not realizing that it is everything around the class that makes things a great class.  Giving back to the class by having a good warm-up with great spirit helps the class run smoothly.  Being the example for everyone up front when being an uke is a greater responsibility and is more beneficial to the student than counting.  Walking the floor and making the personal connection with each student, that will enhance their lives and show them how to interact with others.

Promoting becomes a tremendous part of giving back.  By bringing in students the dojo can expand.  This expansion allows for people to spend their lives dedicated to studying and giving back martial arts to others.  While some people think that promoting is going out and handing out business cards to everyone you meet, or talking to strangers about karate, but is not just that.  Promoting can be as simple as talking to a friend about the art you care about.  It can be answering the phone and setting up a first day.

Martial arts is a tradition that is passed down to others through personal interactions.  You never know what effect you will have one someone’s life by helping them work through a problem.  If you are starting, or have been an instructor for a long time, each interaction you have will help enrich others and your life through they shared experience of martial arts.
