**Life in Tech after 40**

I was a fresh young pup out of college in 1996.  I joined on to a local start up company to develop internet banking software in Java.  Now you may be thinking that this is not so special, except for the fact the Java was on the client side, and it was back by PERL cgi.  I don't bring this up to lay claim to a great technical past but to set the timeframe with what was being done.

The company was essentially split in two, between developers, the young guys and girls, and management, the older crowd.  After the first year of getting the company established, we had several old guys out there doing management.  At 23,
 our CEO was in his mid 40s.  Our development manager was in his upper 30s, and our QA lead was in his mid 30s.  These guys were ancient.  They had wives, kids, and houses.  They would stay at the office and eat lunch instead of going out, having a beer, and playing video games for 2 hours at lunch.  


 As my career grew, I started to become in that position of management.  I was 10 years older than the kids coming out of college.  I had more experience and knowledge that most.   Management knew that I was on top of my technology game, and it was time for me to manage projects, and teams of developers.  I should guide them along and make more people like
  me.   The one problem with this is that I was horrible at managing people.  I had a short temper for not giving your all 100% of your time.  I was one of the first in the office, and one of the last to leave.  Coding was more than a job I enjoyed, it was a hobby for me; it was what i loved to do.


  After a couple of years of this, I began to realize there was no where to go.  Places will try to create senior technical positions that are very difficult to be placed into.  Companies do not want to pay the salary requirements of high level developers.  In my case, it would be working towards a position that I was hands off the technology, and writing papers and proposals for contracts.  This also had no appeal to me.  It was the same non-technical nature as management.

     I was pushing 35, and this is considered over the hill.  At this point, I decided I wanted to be the exception to the rule, so here are some tips to keep you going:

     1.  Be prepared for those you used to help out to be your Manager.  As you are approaching 40, your management is trying to do the same thing they did to you.  They are taking a technologist and trying to figure out what to do with them.  This generally means your manager is either going to stumble and make the same mistakes you did, and there isn't much you can do about it except to mentor this person.  With any luck they will be susceptible to you helping them out.  If not, just be prepared for a lot of frustration.

     2.  Never stop learning new technologies.  Eventually that piece of software that you wrote that you are the expert in will go away.  With the industry, a new language or fad will come along but try to identify true disruptive technologies and learn how they work.  Over the past 10 years, we have seen a few of these come along: Virtualization, Social Media, Distributed Databases, Containers, Automation, Mobile, and DevOps.  Make a goal to familiarize yourself once a year with something new and apply it to what you are currently working on.

     3.  Start contributing back early and often.  It is important to find your pet projects and get involved.  If you have been working on SQL Server for 10 years, get involved with the community; write blogs, do videos, submit for presentations at conferences.  If you plan on spending your life as an expert technologist, make sure that that everyone out there knows you are an expert.  Find other ways to give back as well.  Help a local high school computer club; assist on non-profit software projects.  

     4.  Learn the full stack, you will hear this term often in todayâ€™s resumes.   It is ok to not be an expert with everything, but knowing something about everything is important.  If you are a developer, make sure you understand what it actually takes to install the software your write.  Ensure that you understand the network and hardware sides of things.  If you are an sysadmin, then actually understand the software you are deploying.  These should be the first things on your list of new stuff to learn.  Being the one that can work both sides of the fence is an invaluable skill.

     5. Don't be afraid to jump to the other side of the fence.  I spent 18 years primarily doing java development.  I was working on projects that I had to be the a front-end developer, middleware developer, and database developer.  I had to understand everything, and be able to work on it.  I had to understand how to deploy the software and be available for support.  I spent time being an integrator and systems administrator.  When I got back into a position of being a pure developer, I could see all of the things the admin team were doing incorrectly.  I decided it was time to reinvent myself as an admin and begin to apply my development skills to automating infrastructure.  

     6. The biggest move I made to keep myself interested and relevant was leave the place I worked at for 13 years and start with a new company.  I decided to take a chance and pursue my dreams.  I was over-the-hill and went to an interview just to see what it was like.  I landed my dream job finally at 43 years old.  Not once did someone there ask me about my age or even care.  They cared about the person I was and what I could do.  They had paths to move forward as a technologist.   Long term sports veterans are dependable and consistent; don't stray from this model.  Do not be worried about being too old, show your value that you bring, and be ready to back that up.
